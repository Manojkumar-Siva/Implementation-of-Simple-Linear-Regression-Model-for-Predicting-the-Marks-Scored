# Implementation-of-Simple-Linear-Regression-Model-for-Predicting-the-Marks-Scored

## Aim:
To write a program to predict the marks scored by a student using the simple linear regression model.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
### Step1:
Import the needed packages.
### Step2:
Assigning hours To X and Scores to Y.
### Step3:
Plot the scatter plot.
### Step4:
Use mse,rmse,mae formula to find.

## Program:
```
